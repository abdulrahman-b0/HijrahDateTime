/**
 * A date-time with a time-zone in the Hijrah calendar system,
 * such as `1446-04-18T17:31:30+03:00 Asia/Riyadh`.
 *
 * [ZonedHijrahDateTime] is an immutable representation of a date-time with a time-zone.
 * This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
 * and a time-zone, with a zone offset used to handle ambiguous local date-times.
 * For example, the value
 * "2nd Shawwal 1445 at 13:45.30.123456789 +03:00 in the Asia/Riyadh time-zone"
 * can be stored in a [ZonedHijrahDateTime].
 *
 * This class handles conversion from the local time-line of [HijrahDateTime]
 * to the instant time-line of [Instant].
 * The difference between the two time-lines is the offset from UTC/Greenwich,
 * represented by a [ZoneOffset].
 *
 * Converting between the two time-lines involves calculating the offset using the
 * [ZoneRules] rules accessed from the [ZoneId].
 * Obtaining the offset for an instant is simple, as there is exactly one valid
 * offset for each instant.
 * For Gaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
 * middle of a Gap, then the resulting zoned date-time will have a local date-time
 * shifted forwards by the length of the Gap, resulting in a date-time in the later
 * offset, typically "summer" time.
 *
 * For Overlaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
 * middle of an Overlap, then the previous offset will be retained. If there is no
 * previous offset, or the previous offset is invalid, then the earlier offset is
 * used, typically "summer" time.. Two additional methods,
 * [withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap] and [withLaterOffsetAtOverlap],
 * help manage the case of an overlap.
 *
 * In terms of design, this class should be viewed primarily as the combination
 * of a [HijrahDateTime] and a [ZoneId]. The [ZoneOffset] is
 * a vital, but secondary, piece of information, used to ensure that the class
 * represents an instant, especially during a daylight savings overlap.

 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
